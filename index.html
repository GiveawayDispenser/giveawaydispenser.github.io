<p class="triangle-obtuse top">Some people equate this to a raffle; however raffles by definition require payment to enter, so we use the correct word instead (giveaway) since it's free to enter. Wouldn't want any &quot;small indi companies&quot; to ban us just because they saw the word raffle and assumed RMT without even investigating. English is hard.</p>
  <p>Each giveaway a user enters and does not win, they receive currency. When someone wins, they lose all of their currency.</p>
  <h4 id="what-does-this-currency-do">What does this currency do?</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Each currency you have will increase the minimum size of the dice you roll. The dice starts out rolling 0-1000. So for example, lets say you entered a giveaway and did not win, you get 1 currency. The next giveaway that you enter, instead of rolling a 0-1000 dice to determine if you win (by getting the highest roll), you would roll a 10-1000 sided dice. This effectively increases your odds of getting a higher roll. This effect stacks. So lets say you had 2 currency, you would then roll a 20-1000 sided dice, so on and so forth.</li>

<h4 id="discord-integration">Website Rolls</h4>
<ul>
<li>Upon finalizing a giveaway, all the rolls will be outputted to a sortable, filterable website.<br /></li>

</ul>

  <h4 id="multi-winner-giveaways">Multi Winner Giveaways</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Option to pick multiple winners for a single giveaway. Maybe you want to carry TWO or more people in a key!</li>
  </ul>
  <h4 id="cloud-hosting">Cloud Hosting</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>The bot is hosted in the cloud with automated backups to ensure the bot is always online.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4 id="overflow">Overflow</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Users retain any excess currency after winning a giveaway. As an example, a user has 220 currency, and wins a giveaway. Only 100 of that was actually used to win the giveaway (to make your minimum roll the same as the maximum roll - 1000-1000). With overflow ON, this user would end up with 120 currency after winning. With overflow OFF, this user would end up with 0 currency after winning.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4 id="tiered-or-untiered-subluck">Tiered or Untiered Subluck</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Subluck is enabled by default and can be set per tier level (1, 2 or 3). Think of this as permanent currency that can be used every time you enter a giveaway. Default is 30, 35, 40. Fully customizable.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4 id="winner-countdown-timer-in-chat">Winner Countdown Timer in Chat</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Countdown timer in chat automatically when you use the !winner command. Locking in the winner is done manually via the !lock command to give maximum control to streamer. Starts and ends automatically by using the standard commands. Fully customizable.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4 id="no-luck-used-giveaways">No Luck Used Giveaways</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>An additional type of Giveaway that works the old fashioned way, luck is not used in any way for this type of giveaway.</li>

    </div>
</div>
  <ul>
  <li>Prevent people from entering giveaways immediatley after winning one. Or maybe they cant do another giveaway for five giveaways after they win. Totally customizable.</li>
  </ul>
    <h4 id="discord-integration">Discord Integration</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Upon finalizing a giveaway, all the rolls will be outputted to a designated discord channel.<br /></li>
  <li>Streamer can request a log of all bot commands/history sent through discord in a private channel.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4 id="anti-currency-farming-aka-afkreroll-penalty">Anti-Currency Farming AKA afkreroll penalty</h4>
  <ul id="bot-commands">
  <li>Imagine yourself in a stream that does giveaways for key carries and you are actively watching the stream from your computer at home. You have been trying all day to get into a Dungeon Finder key, but no one is inviting you. You should be rewarded for watching the stream and earning more currency to earn your next win.<br /></li>
  <li>Now, imagine someone at work who hasn't even been trying to get into dungeon finder groups (because they can't even play the game from work), and not even watching the stream who keeps entering every giveaway KNOWING that you cannot accept the free key. They are only trying to &quot;farm&quot; extra luck aka currency for when they get home hours later and enter.<br /></li>
  <li>Now imagine everyone at work entering every single giveaway. Every winner would have to be passed over, and everyone would get free currency. The streamer is now wasting their time having to wait for you to respond and then roll off another winner. How many people will pass on their win? This is not fair for the people who are actually entering the giveaways to WIN now, not try and farm it for later.<br /></li>
  <li>This feature works by penalizing anyone who wins but fails to claim their winnings either because they choose not to accept or if they are afk/do not respond.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Bot Commands</h2>

  <h3 id="running-a-giveaway"><strong>Running a Giveaway</strong></h3>
  <h4>Start a Giveaway</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <li><img src="broadcaster.png" title="Broadcaster" /> <kbd>!sg <em>keyword or phrase</em> --msg <em>giveawayitem</em></kbd> - Short for Start Giveaway. This command will start a giveaway using the keyword or phrase (yes, you can even use the !) given as the method of entering the giveaway. If no keyword or phrase is provided, then it will use the default one stored in the DB. If a keyword or phrase is provided, then it both starts a giveaway AND sets the new default keyword or phrase to that. Viewers enter the giveaway by typing just the keyword or phrase into chat. Examples: <kbd>!sg keyzz --msg Viewer Keys</kbd> <kbd>!sg keyzz</kbd> <kbd>!sg --msg M+ Carry</kbd> <kbd>!sg</kbd><br /></li>
  </li>
  <li><img src="broadcaster.png"title="Broadcaster" /> <kbd>!sgnoluck <em>keyword or phrase</em> --msg <em>giveawayitem</em></kbd> - Short for Start Giveaway No Luck. Same as above but doesnt use luck in any way. See above for same options.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4 id="selecting-a-winner">Selecting a winner</h4>
  <ul>
  <li><img src="broadcaster.png"title="Broadcaster" /> <kbd>!winner <em>pardon</em></kbd> - Select one winner and stop accepting new entrants. This will announce the viewer that had the highest roll. Appending the word &quot;pardon&quot; after !winner will &quot;pardon&quot; the previous winner. A pardoned viewer will be entirely removed from the giveaway and will not incur any afkreroll penalties if they are enabled. If a winner is unable to accept the prize, simply issue another !winner command to get the next highest roll.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4 id="finalizing-the-giveaway">Finalizing the giveaway</h4>
  <ul>
  <li><img src="broadcaster.png"title="Broadcaster" /> <kbd>!lock</kbd> - Finalize the giveaway. This will lock in the last winner announced and finalize the giveaway, distributing all luck to those involved and updating the DB.<br /></li>
  <li><img src="broadcaster.png"title="Broadcaster" /> <kbd>!lock <em>1</em></kbd> - Lock in the last winner announced, but NOT finalize the giveaway. Use this if you wish to have multiple winners in one giveaway.<br /><!---  ![](https://github.com/GiveawayDispenser/images/blob/23bc13927ec053abd7601275b94c2027f780d04d/broadcaster%20icon.png "Broadcaster") <kbd>!lock _2_</kbd> - Finalize the giveaway ONLY.  This will not lock in any winners, use !lock 1 to do that.  For example, this would be a typical use: <kbd>!winner</kbd> -> <kbd>!lock 1</kbd> -> <kbd>!winner</kbd> -> <kbd>!lock</kbd> ---><br /></li>
  <li><img src="broadcaster.png"title="Broadcaster" /> <kbd>!cancel</kbd> - Cancel and end the current giveaway. No luck or stats will result from the giveaway. Useful if you start a giveaway on accident, as a test, or use the wrong keyword.</li>
